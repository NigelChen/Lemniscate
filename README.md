Lemniscate is a simple chat server and client written in Python and Java. The server is written in Python and the client is written in Java. Soon to be written in node.js (web version!). The final result of the project will have a finished GUI and does not require you to go into the code and change everything.

**How to set up the server::**

The server is preconfigured to start with "10.0.1.25" with the port "1337". Be sure to change the host to your ipv4 address and the port to anything you want- as long as it's port forwarded.

To get the ipv4 address of your computer, type in "ipconfig" into cmd. Search for your ipv4 address there.

**Client:**
```
	host = '10.0.1.25' #Your ipv4 address goes here.
	port = 1337 #Your port goes here. (has to be port forwarded)
```


**TODO LIST**

~~- Make a fully functional graphical user interface~~
- Spam filter
- Encryption
- Bot protection
- Users can make own server from the GUI easily.
- Make a global chat through VPS.
