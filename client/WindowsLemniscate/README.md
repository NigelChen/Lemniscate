#Directory

Since this client was made in Microsoft's visual studio, it created loads of files that is basically junk in terms of reading the code itself. For those who don't use VS, here is a little pointer:

`
\lemniscate\main.cs\
`: Where the magic happens. The code is all in there.

`
\Lemniscate.sln\
`: The solution t the VS studio of the program. If you download Visual Studio, then open this file with VS. It'll direct you to the GUI designer and the main.cs code.

`
\lemniscate\main.Designer.cs\
`: Where the GUI design takes place. The code is *pretty unreadable*, it's meant to be opened with visual studio.


`
\lemniscate\bin\lemniscate.exe\
`: Basically where the actual lemniscate program is.

All the other files are useful bullcrap.
